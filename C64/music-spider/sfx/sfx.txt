Sounds recommended for the game:

Music:
Title Screen
Win Screen 
Short "you lost" Jingle (2-5 seconds) when player dies (blue screen)?

Effects:
Item picked up
Question mark (like a 3 note clue sound)
Player moving (might become annoying though, so either very subtle or not at all)
Door opened/closed (essentially just one sound as both happen immediately together when switching rooms)
Wind blowing (like an atmosphere/mood background sound loop when the player is "outside")
Something opens (a lock, a chest, a coffin)

Optional/specific for single use:
Opening a coffin
A church bell (e.g. on the graveyard)
Water/river
The moving spider
Electricity (electric fence, laser beam)
Breaking glass (the box with the shoes, the bottle)
The moving rock on the last screen
Belegro laughing on the last screen
